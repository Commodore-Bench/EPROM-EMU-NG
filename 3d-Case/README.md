Calling it a "case" is a bit of overstatement, it's simply a plastic "base plate" that you can install your emulator into. Adding some rubber feet to it (I use 3M sticky ones) will keep both your emulator and your table "protected". I printed mine with PLA.

There is a Probe_label file in Brother ptouch format and png format, so you print it and attach to the DIP 28 emulator probe
