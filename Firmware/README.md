##Firmware for Arduino Nano

Currently recommended firmware and software:

*Firmware 2.0rc2 (EPROM_EMU_NG_FW_2.0rc2.ino)
*Software 2.0rc3 (EPROM_NG_v2.0rc3.py in Software folder)

If you want to try new features (increased speed of transfer, support for EEPROM) use the following:

*Firmware 2.0rc8 (EPROM_EMU_NG_FW_2.0rc8.ino - Arduino sketch)
*Software 2.0rc8 (EPROM_EMU_NG_2.0rc8.py - Python script located in Software folder)
